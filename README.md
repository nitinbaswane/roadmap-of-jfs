### Guiding Philosophy for this Plan:

*   **Project-Based Learning:** Every module culminates in applying the knowledge to a personal project. This is non-negotiable for building a portfolio.
*   **Depth Over Breadth:** It's better to master React *or* Angular than to be mediocre in both. This plan suggests a path but allows for a choice.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Dedicate a minimum of 2-3 hours daily and one full day on the weekend. Treat learning like a part-time job.
*   **The 80/20 Rule:** Focus on the most impactful 20% of concepts that will give you 80% of the results. This plan prioritizes those.

Of course. Here is an in-depth, granular breakdown of each skillset for a Java Full Stack Developer with 4 years of experience. This analysis moves beyond a simple list to explain the *depth of understanding* and *practical application* expected at this career stage.

### Technical Skills: The In-Depth Breakdown

---

#### 1. Core Java: From Syntax to Systems Thinking

A 4-year developer doesn't just know features; they understand their impact on performance, memory, and maintainability.

*   **Java 8+ Mastery:**
    *   **Streams API:** Not just for simple `filter().map().collect()`. You should understand parallel streams (when to use them, the risks of thread synchronization), custom collectors, and the performance implications of intermediate operations.
    *   **Optional:** Used to design APIs that explicitly communicate optionality, preventing `NullPointerException`. You should know to avoid `Optional.get()` and use `orElse()`, `orElseGet()`, and `orElseThrow()` effectively.
    *   **CompletableFuture:** For handling asynchronous programming. You can chain, combine, and handle errors in async tasks, which is crucial for performance in I/O-bound applications.
*   **Memory Management & Performance:**
    *   You understand the Java Memory Model (Heap vs. Stack), the roles of the Young and Old Generations.
    *   You can reason about Garbage Collection: the differences between GC algorithms (G1GC, ZGC, Shenandoah), and you can read GC logs to identify memory leaks and performance bottlenecks.
*   **Concurrency & Multithreading:**
    *   You go beyond `Runnable` and `synchronized`. You understand the `java.util.concurrent` package:
        *   **Thread Pools:** (`ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`) - Configuring core vs. max pool size, choosing the right type of pool (Cached, Fixed, Scheduled).
        *   **Concurrent Collections:** Using `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` instead of manually synchronizing standard collections.
        *   **Locks & Semaphores:** Using `ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock` for more granular control than `synchronized`.
*   **JVM Internals (Basic):** Understanding just-in-time (JIT) compilation, classloading, and how to use basic JVM tuning flags (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`, `-XX:+UseG1GC`) is a key differentiator.

---

#### 2. Framework Knowledge: Mastering the Spring Ecosystem

Experience here means understanding "the magic" behind Spring Boot's auto-configuration and how to extend it.

*   **Spring Boot:**
    *   **Auto-Configuration:** You know how to use `@ConditionalOnProperty`, `@ConditionalOnClass` to create your own auto-configuration starters or override existing ones.
    *   **Actuator:** You use it for production monitoring, have exposed custom health indicators, and integrated it with metrics systems like Prometheus.
    *   **Externalized Configuration:** Mastery of `application.properties`/`.yml`, profiles (dev, prod, test), and using Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration.
*   **Spring Data JPA (Hibernate):**
    *   You understand the Hibernate Session/Persistence Context, the lifecycle of an entity (transient, persistent, detached), and how to manage lazy loading to avoid the `LazyInitializationException`.
    *   You can write complex `@Query` (both JPQL and native) and understand when a native query is necessary for performance.
    *   You have implemented and tuned second-level caching (e.g., with Ehcache).
*   **Spring Security:**
    *   You have implemented stateless JWT-based authentication and authorization.
    *   You understand the security filter chain and can customize it.
    *   You have integrated OAuth2 (e.g., Login with Google/GitHub) or SAML for enterprise single sign-on (SSO).
*   **Beyond REST:**
    *   **Spring WebFlux:** You understand the reactive programming model (Project Reactor's `Mono` and `Flux`) and its benefits for high-concurrency, low-latency applications.
    *   **GraphQL:** You might have used libraries like `graphql-java` or Spring GraphQL to build more efficient APIs for client-specific data fetching.

---

#### 3. Frontend Technologies: Building Scalable User Interfaces

You are expected to make architectural decisions on the frontend, not just implement designs.

*   **JavaScript / TypeScript:**
    *   **Deep JS Knowledge:** Prototypal inheritance, the event loop, promises, and async/await.
    *   **TypeScript:** Not just for types. You use advanced types (`Generics`, `Enums`, `Union Types`), decorators, and understand how to structure a large TS application for maintainability.
*   **Framework Expertise (e.g., React):**
    *   **State Management:** You can choose the right tool for the job: `useState`/`useReducer` for local state, **Redux Toolkit** (the modern, recommended approach) or **Context API** for global state, and libraries like **React Query** or **SWR** for server state.
    *   **Performance Optimization:** You can use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. You understand code-splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
    *   **Testing:** You write unit tests with **Jest** and component interaction tests with **React Testing Library**.
*   **Build Tools:** You have configured Webpack or Vite for optimizations like code splitting, bundle analysis, and environment-specific variables.

---

#### 4. Database Management: Architecture and Performance

You design databases, not just query them.

*   **SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Design:** You can design a normalized schema (3NF) and know when to deliberately de-normalize for performance.
    *   **Performance:** You can read and analyze `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` query plans, create effective indexes (including composite indexes), and understand table partitioning.
    *   **Advanced Features:** You might have used specific features like JSONB columns, full-text search, or geospatial data types.
*   **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Redis):**
    *   **MongoDB:** You understand how to design document schemas for application access patterns, create efficient indexes, and use the aggregation framework for complex data processing.
    *   **Redis:** You use it not just for caching (with strategies like write-through or cache-aside) but also for distributed locks, rate limiting, and as a session store.

---

#### 5. DevOps & CI/CD: Owining the Delivery Pipeline

You are responsible for the code from your machine to production.

*   **CI/CD Pipelines:**
    *   You don't just use pipelines; you author and maintain complex, multi-stage **Jenkinsfiles** or **GitLab CI YAML** configurations.
    *   Pipelines include stages for: building, unit/integration testing, static code analysis (SonarQube), security scanning (OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk), building Docker images, deploying to staging, and running smoke tests.
*   **Containerization & Orchestration:**
    *   **Docker:** You write efficient, multi-stage Dockerfiles to create small, secure images. You use Docker Compose for local development environments that mirror production.
    *   **Kubernetes (K8s):** You can write and understand YAML manifests for core objects: **Deployments** (managing pods), **Services** (network access), **Ingress** (external traffic), **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets** (configuration). You use `kubectl` to debug deployments and pods.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** You have used **Terraform** or **AWS CloudFormation** to provision cloud resources (VPCs, databases, clusters) declaratively, making infrastructure reproducible and version-controlled.

---

#### 6. Cloud Services: Designing for the Cloud

You build cloud-native applications that leverage cloud services effectively.

*   **Core Services (AWS Example):**
    *   **Compute:** You know when to use **EC2** (for control) vs. **Lambda** (Serverless, for event-driven tasks) vs. **ECS/EKS** (Docker containers).
    *   **Data:** You use **RDS** for managed SQL and **DynamoDB** for managed NoSQL. You understand DynamoDB's data modeling (partition/sort keys) and scaling.
    *   **Integration:** You use **SQS** (message queues) and **SNS** (pub/sub) to decouple application components.
*   **Key Skills:**
    *   **IAM:** You follow the principle of least privilege, creating roles and policies for applications and users.
    *   **High Availability & Resilience:** You design systems across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). You understand how to use auto-scaling groups and load balancers (**ELB**/**ALB**/**NLB**).
    *   **Cost Optimization:** You can analyze bills, choose the right instance types (e.g., Spot Instances for batch jobs), and implement tagging strategies.

---

### Soft Skills: The In-Depth Breakdown

*   **Ownership:** You don't say "it's not my job." If a bug is found in production, you take the lead in diagnosing and fixing it, even if it touches areas owned by other teams. You see a project through from a idea to post-release monitoring.
*   **Mentorship:** Your code reviews are insightful. You don't just point out style issues; you suggest better design patterns, ask about edge cases, and explain the "why" behind your feedback to help juniors grow.
*   **Proactive Problem-Solving:** You don't wait for a ticket. You notice a recurring support issue and build a tool to automate the fix. You identify technical debt, quantify its business impact (e.g., "this slows down feature development by 20%"), and propose a plan to address it.
*   **Stakeholder Communication:** You can translate technical complexity into business risk. You can tell a Product Manager "This feature requires a new database index which will take 4 hours," but also explain *why* it's necessary for performance.
*   **Adaptability:** When a project's requirements change drastically (a "pivot"), you don't get frustrated. You reassess the technical approach, communicate the new timeline, and adapt the architecture to the new goals.

This depth across both technical and soft skills is what defines a valuable and promotable 4-year Java Full Stack Developer. You are a technical problem-solver who operates with a high degree of autonomy and begins to influence the technical direction of your team.
