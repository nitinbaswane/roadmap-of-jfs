Of course. Here is a comprehensive, actionable 9-month study plan designed to take a Java Full Stack Developer from foundational knowledge to a proficient, job-ready level by June 2025, incorporating the in-depth skillsets we discussed.

### Guiding Philosophy for this Plan:

*   **Project-Based Learning:** Every module culminates in applying the knowledge to a personal project. This is non-negotiable for building a portfolio.
*   **Depth Over Breadth:** It's better to master React *or* Angular than to be mediocre in both. This plan suggests a path but allows for a choice.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Dedicate a minimum of 2-3 hours daily and one full day on the weekend. Treat learning like a part-time job.
*   **The 80/20 Rule:** Focus on the most impactful 20% of concepts that will give you 80% of the results. This plan prioritizes those.

### The 9-Month Java Full Stack Mastery Plan

#### **Month 1-2: Solidifying the Foundation & Backend Mastery**

**Theme:** Building robust, production-ready RESTful APIs.
**Project:** Design and build a REST API for a complex domain (e.g., a library management system, an e-commerce product catalog with categories).

*   **Week 1-4: Advanced Core Java & Tooling**
    *   **Topics:** Java 17+ (Records, Sealed Classes, Text Blocks), Deep dive into JVM memory management & GC, Concurrency (`CompletableFuture`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, concurrent collections), Unit Testing (JUnit 5, Mockito).
    *   **Action:** Implement core domain logic for your project with full unit test coverage. Set up a Git repository and practice a feature-branch workflow.

*   **Week 5-8: Spring Boot & Data Layer Deep Dive**
    *   **Topics:** Spring Boot Auto-Configuration, Spring Data JPA with Hibernate (Entity Lifecycle, N+1 Problem, Caching), Advanced Querying (`@Query`, Projections, Specifications), REST API best practices (DTOs, Exception Handling, Validation).
    *   **Action:** Build the full REST API for your project. Implement global exception handling, DTO mapping (use MapStruct), and connect it to a PostgreSQL database. Containerize it with a Dockerfile.

#### **Month 3: Frontend Fundamentals & Framework Choice**

**Theme:** Building a modern, component-based UI.
**Project:** Build the frontend for your Month 1-2 project.

*   **Week 9-10: JavaScript/TypeScript & Tooling**
    *   **Topics:** Modern ES6+ JavaScript, TypeScript Fundamentals (Types, Interfaces, Generics), npm/yarn, introduction to a bundler (Vite or Webpack).
    *   **Action:** Set up your frontend project with Vite/Webpack and TypeScript.

*   **Week 11-12: Frontend Framework Core (Choose React Path Shown)**
    *   **Topics:** React Fundamentals (Components, JSX, Props, State - `useState`), Hooks (`useEffect`, `useContext`), Routing (React Router), Managing API calls (fetch/axios).
    *   **Action:** Build the UI for your project. Create pages to list, view, create, and edit entities from your backend API.

#### **Month 4: Full-Stack Integration & Advanced Frontend**

**Theme:** Connecting the pieces and enhancing the user experience.
**Project:** Enhance both frontend and backend of your main project.

*   **Week 13-14: State Management & Advanced UI**
    *   **Topics:** Choose a state management solution (Redux Toolkit is highly recommended for React). Learn component libraries like MUI (Material-UI) or Ant Design.
    *   **Action:** Integrate state management to handle application state globally. Refactor your UI to use a component library for a professional look.

*   **Week 15-16: API Integration & Security**
    *   **Topics:** Secure your backend API with Spring Security (JWT-based authentication). Handle authentication flow on the frontend (login, storing tokens, protected routes).
    *   **Action:** Implement a full login/logout flow. Protect your API endpoints so they require a valid JWT token to access.

#### **Month 5-6: DevOps, Cloud, & Deployment**

**Theme:** "You build it, you run it." Getting your application live.
**Project:** Deploy your full-stack application to the cloud.

*   **Week 17-18: Containers & Orchestration Basics**
    *   **Topics:** Docker Deep Dive (Multi-stage builds for efficient images), Docker Compose for local development. **Kubernetes Fundamentals** (Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress).
    *   **Action:** Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to run your app locally with PostgreSQL. Write basic Kubernetes YAML manifests for your app.

*   **Week 19-22: Cloud Provider & CI/CD (Choose AWS Path Shown)**
    *   **Topics:**
        *   **Cloud (AWS):** IAM, ECR (Container Registry), EKS (Kubernetes Service), RDS (Managed PostgreSQL), S3 (for frontend assets).
        *   **CI/CD:** Build a pipeline with GitHub Actions/GitLab CI to automatically test, build, and deploy your application on push to the main branch.
    *   **Action:** Deploy your application to a managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS). Set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire process.

#### **Month 7-8: Specialization & Advanced Topics**

**Theme:** Branching out from the monolith and deepening expertise.
**Project:** Refactor a module of your main project or start a new, more ambitious microservices project.

*   **Week 23-26: Choose 2-3 Tracks to Deep-Dive:**
    *   **Track A: Microservices:** Spring Cloud (Service Discovery - Eureka, API Gateway, Config Server), Distributed tracing, Resilience4j for circuit breakers.
    *   **Track B: Advanced Data:** Explore a NoSQL database (MongoDB for documents or Redis for caching). Implement it in your project.
    *   **Track C: Advanced Frontend:** Explore Next.js (for React), server-side rendering (SSR), or a new state library (Zustand, React Query).
    *   **Track D: Cloud & DevOps:** Dive deeper into Terraform (IaC) and learn another cloud service (e.g., AWS SQS/SNS for messaging).

#### **Month 9: Polish, Prepare, and Apply**
